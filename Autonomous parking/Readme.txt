This was the final project task was as follows:
1. Robot shoud scan the environment
2. Spot probable parking spot
3. Do path planning
4. Navigate towards the closed parking spot by following the optimal trajectory.

All above requirements were fullfilled
1. Wall follower for scanning the evironment using Lidar distance sensor.
2. Check for all probable parking spot by using Lidar sensor intensity values.
3.1 Get optimal path using Informed RRT* algorithm.
3.2 Reactive based obstacle avoidance using Lidar distance sensor 
4. Follow the trajectory using PID controller. 
5. Code integration 
6. ROS, python and its libraries were used for programming , visualization and execution. 
7. Report preparation and project management
