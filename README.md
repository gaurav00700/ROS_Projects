# ROS
Worked on above ROS projects. 
All the projects are organised as per folders.
1. Autonomous Parking consists of multiple tasks
2. Follow the gap, reactive based algorithm
3. Follow the wall (using PID and conventional)
4. Follow the trajectory using PID controller
5. LIDAR map using ranges (Cartesian and Polar coordinates)
6. Path planning using Informed RRT* algorithm
7. Point2point movement using PID controller
8. SLAM (Occupancy grip mapping)


I hope my work is helpful for your projects.

HAPPY LEARNING :)
